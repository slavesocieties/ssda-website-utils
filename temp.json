Presumably only individuals of predominantly white ancestry are recorded in these documents. These documents were originally bound in a volume entitled, \"Libro quarto de bautismos de blancos\u2026,\" but are now only loose folios.   These records range from 13 January 1816 to 13 February 1839 and comprise pages 1-452. The Spanish entries contain considerably more information than the Latin entries.  At a minimum each Spanish entry records the date of baptism; date of the individual's birth or age at baptism; name of the individual receiving baptism; legitimacy of the individual's birth; if known, the parents' names and nationalities or places of previous residence; godparents' names and places of current residency; name and title of priest who performed the baptism.  Additional information includes: grandparents' names, nationalities or places of previous residence; military rank and/or administrative title of any male mentioned in the entry; previous religious affiliation; marital status; spouse's name; health condition at time of baptism; individual's nationality or place of previous residency.   At a minimum, each Latin entry records name given at baptism, date of baptism, names of sponsors, names of parents, and name of priest who performed the baptism.
