The first set was originally bound in a volume entitled \"Libro 3 bautismos españoles, 1695-1720,\" but are now only loose folios.  Though this first set is supposed to be records of Spaniards (españoles), it contains at least one entry of a young black child (referred to as negra).  This set ranges from 12 January 1695 to 29 April 1720 and comprises folios 1r-13[7]v.  At a minimum, each entry in this first set of baptismal records provides the name of the individual receiving baptism; date of baptism; name and title of priest who performed the baptism; if known, then names of parents; and name/s of godparent/s (padrino/s).  Additional information includes, but is not limited to, the following: the military rank and/or administrative title of any male named in the entry; legitimacy of individual's birth; day of birth or approximate age at baptism; health condition at birth; enslavement status of individual and/or parents, and when applicable, name/s of owner/s.  The second set of baptismal records are abridged entries of baptismal records contained in Box 3.  These abridged baptismal records range from 1640 to 1694.  The years 1657 and 1660 are missing from this set, and the years 1661 and 1694 are incomplete.  ",

There are two sets of marriage records.  The first set of marriage records appears to have been part of a previously-bound volume due to the presence of a highly deteriorated title page that reads, \"Libro de la parroquial mayor de esta ciudad de San Agustin de la Florida donde se asientan los casamientos de los pardos.\"  This first set ranges from October 1735 to May 1763 and comprises folios 1r-53v.  These marriages are between either an español and negro/a, moreno/a, pardo/a, indio/a, or mestizo/a; or between negros, morenos, pardos, indios, and/or mestizos.  The entries explain if the bride and/or groom were previously married, and if so, then to whom and whether the individuals were free or enslaved.  They provide the witnesses' names and parents' names of both the bride and groom, and the nationality or places of previous or current residence.  Some locations that appear in the first set of marriage records include: Apalachee, Arará, Brasil, Carabalí, Carolina, Cartagena, Conga, Guinea, Havana, Inglaterra, Isla de la Palma, Jamaica, Machaba, Madrid, Mandinga, Mina, Nueva Inglaterra, Palica, Samba, Tenerife, Tolomato.  The second set of marriage records also appears to have been part of a previously-bound volume due to the presence of a highly deteriorated title page that reads, \"Libro de matrimonios de la parroquial de San Agustin de la Florida.\"  This second set ranges from June 1720 to August 1756 and comprises folios 1r-218v.  These marriages are almost entirely between españoles.  The baptismal records comprise a single folio and document baptisms of both negros and españoles during May 1720. ",

Though the pagination is sequential, without any pages missing, various dates are unaccounted for (missing years: most of 1755, and all of 1756-1761).  Folios 1-25 contain August 1735 through January 1745; folios 25-27 contain April 1745; folios 28-45 contain April 1754 through February 1755; folios 46-67 contain December 1762 through April 1763.  The earlier records seem to only document confirmations of white Europeans or Creoles.  Each entry gives the first name of the individual, and full names of the parents and godparents.  In some instances, in place of the parents' names, a nationality is provided.  For instance, \"de nación de Suisa\" (fol. 26r) and \"aleman\" (fol. 27r).  By the 1760s, entries appear that include confirmations of negros and morenos either free or enslaved.  The burial records were oringally bound in a volume entitled \"Libro 3 de entierros de españoles.\"  These burial records range from 19 July 1743 through 17 November 1763 and comprise folios 1r-155v.  All entries state the name of the individual who was buried, the parents' names (if known), and the date of burial.  Additional information includes, but is not limited to, the following: the individual's occupation, approximate age, heirs, nationality or place of previous residency, and spouse's name.  There is also a random folio containing burial records of two men who died at the Spanish fort in Apalachee in 1743 and short entries regarding burials in the years 1754 and 1756.  ",

Additional information includes, but is not limited to, the following: the individual's date of birth, health condition at time of baptism, place that baptism occurred, and political or military position of parent and/or godparent.  The second type of baptismal entry records church decrees, which mandate the entry of previously-performed baptisms into the libros de bautismos de españoles de Florida.  Each entry has two dates: the date of the church decree and the date of the actual baptism.  These entries are ordered chronologically by the date of the church decree, which range from 1780 to 1820.  The dates of the baptisms range from 1740 to 1791.  These entries comprise folios 73r-75v.  Information in the church decrees include:  the date of the decree (auto),  who presented the decree,  and who carried out the decree.

There are four parts.  The first part is an index of marriages presumably between Minorcans.  Each marriage is listed twice: once by the first letter of the bride's surname, and once by the first letter of the groom's surname.  The entries are then placed in chronological order according to the date of the marriage.  The index covers all of the marriages from Box 14 - Golden Book of the Minorcans, and partially from Box 18 - Marriages and Box 27 - Marriages.  The second part contains abridged marriage entries (COMPLETE THIS PART)   The third part contains abridged entries from baptismal records contained in the fifth book of white baptisms (Box 33) and ranges from 1839-1851.  Each abridged entry provides the name of the individual being baptised, the date of the baptism, and the associated entry number.  The fourth part contains a single marriage entry from 1854.",
